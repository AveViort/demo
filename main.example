This is the initial release. Let's call it v 1.0.

Oh no,  have realized that I made a mistake and need to add a bugfix. Now this is v 1.1.1 beta

Oh no, my bugfix was bad. But this is the dev branch, so attempt #2: v 1.1.2

New vulnerability on the Internet! I had to add this hotfix directly to stable version, without testing in dev! Also, dev version has some unstable functions.

Now I need an additional library. I will upload it to dv branch and call it library-1.example. Version is now 1.2.5to demonstrate changes. Let's discuss later how to mark versions.

Version 1.3 beta is here!

Version 2.0 beta! Some code deleted, now it uses somelibrary v 2.0
